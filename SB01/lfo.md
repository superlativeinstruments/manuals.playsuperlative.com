## Modulator / LFO

<article>

The `MODULATOR` section of the front panel includes the `LFO/CLK RATE` slider and the `WAVEFORM` selector knob.

The Modulator is a low-frequency oscillator (LFO) that can be used to automate a number of parameters across the synth including pitch, pulse width, filter cutoff.

The `LFO/CLK RATE` slider controls the frequency of the LFO.

The `WAVEFORM` selector switch controls the shape of the LFO. It can be configured for triangle, square, random, or noise. The random waveform generated by a sample and hold circuit. Each tick of the LFO will produce a new random modulation amount that is steady for the period of the LFO. The noise waveform is just white noise and is not affected by the LFO rate control.

The speed of the LFO also controls the speed of the arpeggiator and sequencer and can be selected as a trigger source for the envelope.
