## Storing and Recalling Sequences

<article>

The SB01 has 64 memory locations split across two banks that can be used for storing user sequences.

Each key on the keyboard represents a save location, of which there are 32 total in each bank. The currently active sequence can be saved to memory while while stopped or playing.

### Saving a Sequence

* **Save to Bank A:** Press and hold `SHIFT` + `WRITE A` + `ANY KEY` location.
* **Save to Bank B:** Press and hold `SHIFT` + `WRITE B` + `ANY KEY` location.
:::
**Tip:** Writing to a save location will overwrite any existing stored sequence.

### Recalling Sequences

* **Jump Mode:**
    * Hold the `JUMP` button and press a `KEY` location to jump to the stored sequence.
    * The target sequence will start immediately on the next clock step
    * The target sequence can be restarted by pressing the same location again.
:::

* **Chain Mode:**
    * Hold the `CHAIN` button and press a `KEY` location to chain to the stored sequence.
    * The target sequence will start immediately after the current sequence finishes playing.
    * Multiple `KEY` locations can be entered in this recall mode, and the sequencer will chain all queued sequences in order of entry until starting over.



* **Modulo Mode:**
    * Hold the `JUMP` +  `CHAIN` buttons and press a `KEY` location to "Modulo" jump to the stored sequence.
