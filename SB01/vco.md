## Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)

The voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) is where the sound of the SB01 is created.

The `MOD` control adjust the amount that the LFO will change the pitch of the oscillator.

The `RANGE` knob controls the octave of the oscillator.

### Pulse Width

Pulse width (sometimes called duty cycle) is the proportion of time that a pulse waveform is high or low.  
For example, a square wave has equal parts high and low, like this:

<div style="width: 66.666%;">

![FIGURE 1.1](assets/pulse-width-1.svg)

</div>

While a wave with a narrower pulse width may look like this:

<div style="width: 66.666%;">

![FIGURE 1.2](assets/pulse-width-2.svg)

</div>

Both of these examples have the same frequency, so the pitch of the note is is the same, but because of the changes in pulse width, they will have a different timbre and spectral characteristics.

 

The `PULSE WIDTH` switch controls the mode that the pulse width modulation will operate in.

When the switch is set to `MAN`ual, the `PULSE WIDTH` slider will directly control the pulse width of the oscillator.

When the switch is set to `LFO`, the LFO will control the pulse width of the oscillator, and the `PULSE WIDTH` slider will control the amount of modulation that is applied.

When the switch is set to `ENV` , the envelope generator will control the pulse width of the oscillator, and the `PULSE WIDTH` slider will control the amount that the envelop affects the pulse width.
