The Source Mixer section contains controls to mix together the tone sources created by the `VCO` into various timbres, with the addition of noise and sub-oscillator waveforms.

The `PULSE` slider controls the amount of pulse waveform that is mixed in. The pulse width is configured using the controls in the VCO section.

The `SAW` slider controls the amount of sawtooth wave that is mixed in.

The `SUB OSC` slider controls the amount of sub-oscillator that is mixed in. The sub-oscillator is a waveform that is divided in half from the main oscillator and will thus follow the pitch. Using the `SUB OSC` switch, the sub oscillator can be set to:

- A square wave one octave below the main oscillator
- A square wave two octaves below
- A 25% duty cycle pulse wave two octaves below

The `NOISE` slider controls the amount of white noise that is mixed in.
