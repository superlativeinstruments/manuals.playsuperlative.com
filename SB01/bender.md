The main performance element of the bender section is the joystick.

#### LFO Mod / Vibrato

Pushing the joystick forward increases the amount of `LFO` modulation (Sine wave) that is applied to `VCO` pitch. The maximum amount of modulation is set by the `LFO MOD` knob above the joystick.

#### Vibrato Latch

Clicking the joystick will momentarily toggle the `LFO`  vibrato modulation on. Holding `SHIFT` while clicking the joystick will latch the vibrato on and off, having the same effect as pushing the joystick forward.

#### Pitch and Filter Bend

The left and right direction of the bender joystick can be configured to control both the oscillator pitch and the filter cutoff. The `BENDER VCO` and `BENDER VCF` controls set the depth of modulation applied to each parameter when the joystick is moved.

#### Mod CV

The `MOD CV` input can be used to control the bender using an external control voltage. Signal applied to the `MOD CV` input is equivalent to moving the bender joystick to the right.
