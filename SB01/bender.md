The main performance element of the bender section is the joystick.

### Pitch Modulation / Vibrato

Pushing the joystick up will increase the amount of LFO modulation that is sent to the VCO pitch. The maximum amount of added modulation is controlled by the `LFO MOD` knob above the joystick. Increasing the knob will increase the depth of pitch modulation that is added when the joystick is pushed up. The rate of LFO modulation is controlled by the `LFO/CLK RATE` slider in the `LFO` section.

### Pitch Bend and Filter Control

The left and right direction of the bender joystick can be configured to control both the oscillator pitch and the filter cutoff. The `BENDER VCO` and`BENDER VCF` sliders control the amount of change to each parameter when the joystick is moved left or right. At the lowest slider position, no change will be made.

### Mod CV

The `MOD CV` input can be used to control the bender using an external control voltage. Signal applied to the `MOD CV` input is equivalent to moving the bender joystick to the right.
