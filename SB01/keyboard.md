# Keyboard

<article>

The SB01 has 32 keys and 2.5 octaves, but can be played as a 56 key keyboard by using the `TRANSPOSE` button.

With the `RANGE` of the VCO is set to 8' and the `TRANSPOSE` is set to `NORMAL`, the lowest C note maps to the middle C of a piano.

### Hold

Any key played can be held on after release by using the `HOLD` button (indicator will light). 

When applied during a sequence, the `HOLD` function will sustain every note. The `PEDAL` input will also activate the `HOLD` function when pressed, similar to the damper pedal of a piano.

### Transpose

To enable the Transpose function, hold the `TRANSPOSE` button down while pressing any key except for the lowest C key. The indicator will light and the keyboard will now play in the key of the chosen note.

- If you press a key *lower* than the lowest C, it will be transposed *down* by the distance in pitch between the pressed key and the C.
- If you press a key *higher* than the loewst C, it will be transposed *up* by the interval between the pressed key and C.

To disable the Transpose function, hold the `TRANSPOSE` button down while pressing the lowest C. The indicator will go out and the SB01 has retruend to the normal condition (the key of C.)

*Tip:* You can freely change transposition while the Arpeggiator or Sequencer are playing.

### Transpose Latching{.unlisted}

Press `SHIFT` + `TRANSPOSE` to activate the transpose `LATCH` function. This mode allows the function to latch ON without needing to hold the button down while pressing a new key, allowing a single hand to dynamically transpose a running arpeggiator or sequence.
