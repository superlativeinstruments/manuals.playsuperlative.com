## Internal / External Channel

<article>

The SB01 has two parallel and independent sequencer channels for 

Each channel button represents the active control window, which shows the current state of the sequencer, arpeggiator, hold, and transpose function for the selected channel. Both channels can be controlled controlled together in `BOTH` mode.

### INTERNAL Channel

The `INTERNAL` track will always correspond to the internal synth "engine" of the SB01. 

### EXTERNAL Channel

The `EXTERNAL` track offers a layer of external control on top of the internal synth, allowing the keyboard, arpeggiator, and sequencer to control an external device that accepts CV, MIDI, or USB MIDI. 

### BOTH mode

Hold the `INTERNAL` and `EXTERNAL` buttons together to enter `BOTH` mode. While both channel LED's are lit, all button actions will now apply to both channels. 

When a function is active in both tracks, the button will toggle between `INT` and `EXT` channel colors to reflect this.
Exit BOTH mode by pressing INT or EXT to enter an individual channelâ€™s control.

### Recalling Sequences

#### Jump Mode:

Hold the `JUMP` button and press a `KEY` location to jump to the stored sequence.
