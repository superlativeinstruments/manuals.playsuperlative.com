# Internal / External Channel

<article>

The SB01 has a unique dual channel control architecture consisting of two parallel and independent keyboard and sequencer channels.

Each channel button represents the active control window, which shows the current state of the sequencer, arpeggiator, hold, and transpose functions for the selected channel. Both channels share the same clock, and can also be controlled together in `BOTH` mode.

### Internal Channel

The `INTERNAL` track will always correspond to the internal synth "engine" of the SB01. 

### External Channel

The `EXTERNAL` track offers another control layer on top of the internal synth, allowing a second keyboard, arpeggiator, and sequencer to freely control an external device that accepts CV, MIDI, or USB MIDI. 

### BOTH mode

Hold the `INTERNAL` and `EXTERNAL` buttons together to enter `BOTH` mode. While both channel LED's are lit, all button actions will now apply to both channels. 

When a function is active in both tracks, the button will toggle between `INT` and `EXT` channel colors to reflect this.
Exit BOTH mode by pressing INT or EXT to enter an individual channelâ€™s control.
