# Arpeggiator

<article>

The Arpeggiator will automatically play any held notes as a progressive arpeggio.

Use the `HOLD` button to latch notes into the Arpeggiator and free hands for adjusting the sound.

Without using the `HOLD` function , any new notes played into the Arpeggiator will reset the `LFO/CLK RATE` on the first key press.

The speed of the Arpeggiator is controlled by the speed of the `LFO/CLK RATE`. If the SB01 is configured to accept an external MIDI clock, the rate of the Arpeggiator will follow.

### Arpeggiator Modes

To enable the Arpeggiator, press or combine any of the three Arpeggiator mode buttons:

1. `UP`: plays the arpeggiated notes from lowest to highest
2. `U+D`: plays the arpeggiated notes from lowest to highest then reverses
3. `DOWN`: plays the arpeggiated notes from highest to lowest
4. `U+D` + `UP`: caterpillar up mode — the pattern will move two steps forward and one step backward
5. `UP` + `DOWN`: corner mode — the pattern will repeat the first and last steps before changing direction
6. `DOWN` + `U+D`: caterpillar down mode — the pattern will move two steps backward and one step forward
7. `DOWN` + `U+D` + `UP`: plays the arpeggiated notes in random order
