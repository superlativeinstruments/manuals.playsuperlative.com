## Power

To turn the SB01 on, slide the power switch on the leftmost corner of the unit.

The SB01 is powered by a rechargeable battery. To charge the battery, connect a USB-C power supply to the `USB` connection on the back of the unit. The LED above the `TUNE` knob should turn green to indicate that the unit is charging. When the SB01 is on but not charging, this light will be amber. The battery can be charged both while the SB01 is switched on or while it is switched off.

If the unit is low on battery, the LED above the `TUNE` knob will blink amber.

### Checking the battery level

To check the battery level of the SB01, hold down the `SHIFT` button and then press and hold the `BANK SELECT` button. The approximate battery level will be indicated by the seven LEDs in the leftmost bank of buttons. More green LEDs means a higher charge.
