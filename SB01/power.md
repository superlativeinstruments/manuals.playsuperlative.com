The SB01 is powered by a rechargeable battery. To turn the synth on, slide the power switch on the left corner of the unit towards the right. *The power LED above the `TUNE` knob will light amber.*

To charge the synth, connect a USB-C power supply to the `USB` connection on the back of the unit. *The power LED will turn green to indicate that the unit is currently charging.*

- If the synth is low on battery, the power LED will begin blinking at the rate of the `LFO`. 
- If depleted, the power LED will flash but the synth will not play until charged again.
