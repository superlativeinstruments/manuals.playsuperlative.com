## Power

To turn the SB-01 on, slide the power switch on the leftmost corner of the unit.

The SB-01 is powered by a rechargeable battery. To charge the battery, connect a USB-C power supply to the `USB` connection on the back of the unit. The LED above the `TUNE` knob should turn green to indicate that the unit is charging. When the SB-01 is on but not charging, this light will be amber. The battery can be charged both while the SB-01 is switched on or while it is switched off.

If the unit is low on battery, the LED above the `TUNE` knob will blink amber.

## Checking the battery level

To check the battery level of the SB-01, hold down the `SHIFT` button and then press and hold the `BANK SELECT` button. The approximate battery level will be indicated by the seven LEDs in the leftmost bank of buttons. More green LEDs means a higher charge.

## Powering external gear

The SB-01 can also be used as a battery bank to power external gear. Simply connect a device to the USB port on the back of the SB-01. You can even charge your phone from it!
