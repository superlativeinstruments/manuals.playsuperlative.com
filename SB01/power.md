## Power

<article>

To turn the SB01 on, slide the power switch on the left corner of the unit towards the right.

The SB01 is powered by a rechargeable battery. To charge the battery, connect a USB-C power supply to the `USB` connection on the back of the unit. The LED above the `TUNE` knob should turn green to indicate that the unit is charging. When the synth is on but not charging, this light will be amber. The battery can be charged both while the synth is switched on or while it is switched off.

If the unit is low on battery, the LED above the `TUNE` knob will begin blinking. If depleted, the LED will flash but the synth will not play until charged again.

### Powering external gear

The SB01 can also be used as a power source for external gear using it's built-in battery. Simply connect a device to the USB port on the back of the synth while power is active. You can even charge your phone from it.
