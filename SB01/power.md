The SB01 is powered by a rechargeable battery. To turn the synth on, slide the power switch on the left corner of the unit towards the right. The power LED above the `TUNE` knob will light amber.

To charge the synth, connect a USB-C power supply to the `USB` connection on the back of the unit. The LED above the `TUNE` knob will turn green to indicate that the unit is currently charging.

If the unit is low on battery, the LED above the `TUNE` knob will begin blinking at the rate of the `LFO`. If depleted, the LED will flash but the synth will not play until charged again.

#### Powering external gear

The SB01 can also be used as a power source for external gear using it's built-in battery. Simply connect a device to the USB port on the back of the synth while power is active. You can even charge your phone from it.
