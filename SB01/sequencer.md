### Sequencer Play Directions

To change the sequencer playback direction, hold `SHIFT` and press any of the three Arpeggiator mode buttons:

- `DOWN`: plays the sequence notes from last note to first
- `U+D`: reverses play direction after reaching the last note
- `UP`: plays the sequence from first note to last
- `DOWN` + `U+D` + `UP`: plays the sequence in random order

**Tip:** You can switch directions while the sequencer is playing.

Both the `INT` and `EXT` tracks can have independent sequencer directions.

Sequence directions are not retained when storing a sequence.
