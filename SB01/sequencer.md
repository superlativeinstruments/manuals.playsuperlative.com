### Sequence Play Directions

To change the sequencer playback direction, hold `SHIFT` and press or combine any of the three Arpeggiator mode buttons:

1. `UP`: plays the sequence from first note to last
2. `U+D`: play direction reverses after reaching the last note
3. `DOWN`: plays the sequence from last note to first
4. `U+D` + `UP`: caterpillar up mode — the sequence will move two steps forward and one step backward 
5. `UP` + `DOWN`: corner mode — the sequence will repeat the first and last steps before changing direction 
6. `DOWN` + `U+D`: caterpillar down mode — the sequence will move two steps backward and one step forward 
7. `DOWN` + `U+D` + `UP`: plays the sequence in random order

**Tip:** You can switch directions while the sequencer is playing.

Both the `INT` and `EXT` tracks can have independent sequencer directions.

Sequence directions are not retained when storing a sequence.
