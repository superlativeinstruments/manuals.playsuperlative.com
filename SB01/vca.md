The voltage controlled amplifier (VCA) section controls the amplitude, or volume of a note over time as it is played.

When the VCA is set to `GATE` mode, the volume of the note will be at the maximum as soon as a note is played, and will stop as soon as the note is released.

When the VCA is set to `ENV` mode, the volume of the note will follow the shape of the envelope section.
