## Voltage Controlled Amplifier (VCA)

<article>

The voltage controlled amplifier (VCA) section controls the volume of a note over time as it is played.

When the VCA is configured in `GATE` mode, the volume of the note will be at the maximum as soon as a note is played, and will be reduced to the minimum as soon as the note is released.

When the VCA is configured in `ENV` mode, the volume of the note will be controlled over time based on the settings in the envelope section.
